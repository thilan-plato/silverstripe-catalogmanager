# SilverStripe Catalog Manager

Catalog administration via a LeftAndMain like interface. Lets you edit and create pages outside of the SiteTree.

## Features

## Compatibility

This module is compatible with:
- SilverStripe 4.x
- SilverStripe 5.x

The module automatically handles the differences between SilverStripe 4 and 5, particularly around GridField extensions which moved to the core framework in SilverStripe 5.

## Installation

Installation via composer

```bash
$ composer require littlegiant/silverstripe-catalogmanager
```

## How to use

### Pages

Add the following to a configuration yml file:

```yml
CatalogPage:
  extensions:
    - CatalogPageExtension
  parent_classes:
    - CatalogParentPage
```

Where `CatalogPage` is the page type you wish to administer (e.g. BlogEntry) and `CatalogParentPage` is where the pages
should be stored in the SiteTree (e.g. BlogHolder). You may have multiple instances of the parent, the administration
will provide users with a drop down to choose which page should be the parent.

You can also create pages in the root of the project (i.e. ParentID = 0) by not providing a parent class.

```yml
LandingPage:
  extensions:
    - CatalogPageExtension
```

Then simply extend `CatalogPageAdmin` instead of `ModelAdmin`.

### DataObjects

You can also manage DataObjects through the `CatalogDataObjectExtension`

### Translations

If you are using the translatable module, you can use the TranslatableCatalogExtension to provide functionality for
choosing languages.

```yml
CatalogPageAdmin:
  extensions:
    - TranslatableCatalogExtension
```

### Options

#### Hide pages in CMS

When managing pages with catalogmanager you might want to hide this pages in CMS. You can do this by adding the `HidePageChildrenExtension` to the holder page, e.g.

```yml
CatalogPage:
  extensions:
    - CatalogPageExtension
  parent_classes:
    - 'CatalogParentPage'
CatalogParentPage:
  extensions:
    - HidePageChildrenExtension
```

#### Duplication of pages
You can disable the ability to duplicate pages through the `can_duplicate` configuration setting per object.

```yml
CatalogPage:
  extensions:
    - CatalogPageExtension
  parent_classes:
    - 'CatalogParentPage'
  can_duplicate: false
```

#### Drag and drop sorting

You can add drag and drop sorting using GridFieldSortableRows when you add the `sort_column` setting to your configuration.
Uses column `Sort` by default which is default in SiteTree and is added by CatalogDataObjectExtension.

```yml
CatalogPage:
  extensions:
    - CatalogPageExtension
  parent_classes:
    - 'CatalogParentPage'
  sort_column: 'CustomSort'
```

If you want to disable drag and drop sorting just set `sort_column` to false

```yml
CatalogPage:
  extensions:
    - CatalogPageExtension
  parent_classes:
    - 'CatalogParentPage'
  sort_column: false
```

Sort columns automatically update the sort column of both the staged and live versions of the object. To disable this,
you can set the configuration option `automatic_live_sort` to false through your config.

```yml
CatalogPage:
  extensions:
    - CatalogPageExtension
  parent_classes:
    - 'CatalogParentPage'
  automatic_live_sort: false
```
